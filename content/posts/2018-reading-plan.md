Even though we're almost a month in, there's still plenty of time left in the year to get started reading if you haven't already. And if you need a list, that's what this is for.

The basic list structure contains one series, often a trilogy, each two months. (Edit: I am also spacing out an additional series, James S. A. Corey's The Expanse, over the remaining year.) At the end of the main list, I will offer up the list of books from which I am supplementing this, because the nature of the main list makes for a faster reading pace than I can manage with classics. I will endeavor to write up some thoughts on what I am reading, but I don't want to make promises I can't keep.

## December/January ##
The first series is N.K. Jemisin's The Broken Earth trilogy:
* _The Fifth Season_
* _The Obelisk Gate_
* _The Stone Sky_

Update: I've completed this series as of 1/20/2018.

## February/March ##
Kim Stanley Robinson's _Science in the Captial_ series was collected in an omnibus edition called _Green Earth_. You may notice a strong environmental thread in this list.

Bonus: _Leviathan Wakes_ by James S. A. Corey

## April/May ##
Cixin Liu's series _Remembrance of Earth's Past_ comprises three volumes, two of which were translated by award-winning author Ken Liu.
* _The Three-Body Problem_
* _The Dark Forest_
* _Death's End_

Bonus: _Caliban's War_ by James S. A. Corey

## June/July ##
The late, great, Terry Pratchett collaborated with Stephen Baxter to produce a five volume series called _The Long Earth_:

* _The Long Earth_
* _The Long War_
* _The Long Mars_
* _The Long Utopia_
* _The Long Cosmos_

Bonus: _Abaddon's Gate_ by James S. A. Corey

## August/September ##
This was originally allotted for Charlie Stross's _Empire Games_ series, but the last volume of this won't be available until January of 2019. I am tentatively replacing this with Octavia E. Butler, either her _Xenogenesis_ series, or _Earthseed_. I may just do both, since that's 5 volumes, and both series are thematically related to the others in the main list. The other contender is Nnedi Okorafor, who won a Nebula and a Hugo for _Binti_, the first book in her recently completed trilogy. Assuming I stick with Butler:
* _Dawn_
* _Adulthood Rites_
* _Imago_

And/or:
* _Parable of the Sower_
* _Parable of the Talents_

Bonus: _Cibola Burn_ by James S. A. Corey

## October/November ##
Of the items on this list, Ada Palmer's Terra _Ignota_ is the least familiar to me.
* _Too Like the Lightning_
* _Seven Surrenders_
* _The Will to Battle_

Bonus: _Nemesis Games_ by James S. A. Corey

## Ongoing ##
I'm making my way through _War and Peace_ again, at the pace of a chapter a day; it will take me all year to read it again. _Mahabharata_ is still in my rotation as well.

## Supplements ##
From my list of supplements, I have already begun _Watership Down_ by Richard Adams. I also have _Cloud Atlas_ by David Mitchell, _The Trial_ by Franz Kafka, _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ by Walter M. Miller, Jr., _This Side of Paradise_ by F. Scott Fitzgerald, _Notes from Underground_ by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and _The Three-Cornered World_ by Soseki Natsume. These I will pick up as time permits between other readings.
