I haven't posted one of these in a while, in part because my reading over the past several years had been too sporadic. For 2024, I didn't specifically plan out much, except for some time I was following along with the the reading schedule (delayed!) of [Shelved By Genre](http://rangedtouch.com/category/shelved-by-genre/), specifically as they read through Ursula K. Le Guin's _Earthsea_ series. Nevertheless, I managed more than I thought I would, and certainly more than I had in previous years, even if some of the reading was _very_ slow. Anyway here's what I read.

1. _A Wizard of Earthsea_ by Ursula K. Le Guin
2. _Whale_ by Cheon Myong-kwan, translated by Chi-Young Kim
3. _The Tombs of Atuan_ by Ursula K. Le Guin
4. (Abandoned) _En Agosto Nos Vemos_ by Gabriel García Márquez
5. _The Farthest Shore_ by Ursula K. Le Guin
6. _The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. Le Guin
7. _Mythago Wood_ by Robert Holdstock
8. _Gardens of the Moon_ by Steven Erikson
9. (Abandoned) _Gloriana, or, The unfulfill'd queen : being a romance_ by Michael Moorcock
10. _The Last Pomegranate Tree_ by Bachtyar Ali, translated by Kareem Abdulrahman
11. _Lord Foul's Bane_ by Stephen R. Donaldson
12. _Diplomatics: The Science of Reading Medieval Documents - A Handbook_ by Federico Gallo

I have sort of resolved to read down my pile of Archipelago Books, and am looking at a few standouts published in 2024. I also have in mind to read a bit more nonfiction, which I had almost completely abandoned. As usual, however, we'll see.
