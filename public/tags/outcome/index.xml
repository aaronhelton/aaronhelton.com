      <description>The idea for this has been percolating for a while, but it finally managed to escape my head. I do not guarantee it’s complete or usable, but here is my attempt to map out the tension between intention and outcome. Suggestions for improvement are most welcome.
The reason for this map is to examine the landscape within which people operate, especially as it relates to social good. I’ve never been completely comfortable with the idea that “it’s the thought that counts,” because clearly there are situations in which this is not true.</description>
