      <description>Update on The Epic of Gilgamesh
Source: http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/gods/explore/bullheav.html
As I am finishing up my reading of The Epic of Gilgamesh, I started this morning on the portion of the Sumerian poems used as the source for Tablet XII.

Gilgamesh by Union (Wikipedia)
The second book in my Sacer-Epic Reading Journey is The Epic of Gilgamesh.

It has cast its shadow on numerous later works, including Homer’s epics and the Bible.</description>
