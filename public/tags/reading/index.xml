      <description>Since mid-March, my reading schedule is provisional and inconsistent. Like many others, I am working from home, which has wreaked havoc on any sense of routine, even though I do my best to cling to what I can. Still, while I am confident that much of my original reading plan will stay firmly off the rails, there is no reason to abandon hope.
Often, I make plans but lose interest in them anyway.</description>

      <title>2020 Reading List</title>

      <description>2019 was not a banner year for me in reading, a fact I blame on the lack of a reading list. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that I need a some means of guiding my reading for the year, especially if I have a particular theme or set of themes I am exploring.
In keeping with earlier themes, I am returning in 2020 to epics, one a month if I can read that fast.</description>

      <title>2017 Year in Reading</title>

      <description>(Note: This post was rescued from Medium, where it first appeared. It is here for archival purposes.)
My goal for 2017 was to read 12 sacred/epic texts at the pace of one a month. The selection of texts was based on a combination of familiarity with source material and a slight stretch beyond the familiar into stories that, at least for me, were not as familiar. Before I began compiling the list, for instance, I had a good handle on Greek and Roman mythology, as well as some of the Northern European stories.</description>
