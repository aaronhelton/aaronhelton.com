      <description>I’ve been thinking about structural violence, especially as it relates to systems of human organization. This was prompted by David Graeber’s excellent 2006 essay “Beyond Power/Knowledge: an exploration of the relation of power, ignorance and stupidity,” (available here and elsewhere: http://www2.lse.ac.uk/publicEvents/pdf/20060525-Graeber.pdf) in which he argues, among other things, that states tend to diffuse their monopoly on violence through bureaucratic abstractions. What I want to explore is the question of whether we can say that such bureaucratic abstractions in fact reduce the level of structural violence in a society or whether the total structural violence remains the same.</description>
