      <description>A roundup of my media consumption for the year.
Music I come at music like this: I try lots of things, but take note of little. What rises to the top for me isn’t necessarily what others find great (and in fact I can’t always see the greatness others see), but rather something, usually idiosyncratic, that helps the artist stand out. That’s not to say I am completely ignorant of things like airplay and promotional hype, nor do I fully reject those aspects of an artist&amp;rsquo;s trajectory, but I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily march to the same beat.</description>
