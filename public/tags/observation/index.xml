      <description>Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll walk today. God knows it&amp;rsquo;s a good day for it, one of the nicest in months, and you&amp;rsquo;ve always liked getting the exercise anyway. The sun is out and everything. Perhaps the sidewalk will have filled with the people whom you suspect of springing forth merely to be observed by you (rest assured, they suspect the same of you). If you are pensive or brooding today, you might like some earbuds.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to imagine that some or all of this could be under water one day. The models show the possibility, though. They also show that this neighborhood could withstand a bigger force than Sandy. That’s only reassuring until you remember that by the time it hit, Sandy was a ghost of its former self, registering at the lowest setting for the definition of hurricane.
Perhaps I’ll walk down Ditmars today.</description>
